## Abstract
Researchers disagree about the impact of climate change on conflict among the Maya during the Classic period (ca. 250-900 CE). Some contend that increasing aridity exacerbated conflict, while others have found that increasing temperature ramped up conflict. Here, we report a study in which we sought to resolve this disagreement. We collated annually-resolved conflict and climate data, and then created a Bayesian time-series model for analysing count-based prehistoric and historic data. We carried out three analyses, one covering more or less the whole of the Classic Period (292-900 CE), one focused on the Early Classic (292-600 CE), and one that concentrated on the Late Classic (600-900 CE). Our analyses indicated that climate change likely did impact Classic Maya conflict levels, but our results differed from those of previous studies in two important ways. First, we found that the impact of climate change is only evident during the Late Classic. Second, we found that while increasing summer temperature exacerbated conflict, increasing aridity suppressed it. Thus, our study offers a new, more complex perspective on Classic Maya climate-conflict dynamics. It also has implications for our understanding of other aspects of Classic Maya history and for the debate about the likely impact of the current bout of climate change on conflict levels.

## Software
The R scripts provide in this repo require [*Nimble*](https://r-nimble.org/), a new R package for writing Bayesian statistical models in the BUGS language from R. You will need to install that package in order to run the scripts. You will also need the data we used in the paper.
